# DataVisualization_Crypto
This repository contains a code to import cryptocurrency historical prices thanks to cryptocompare
It allows to build a function that returns a graph of the price evolution for a cryptocurrency over a given last number of days measured on a given fiat currency. 
It also allows to save directly your graph on your directory with the name comprised of the crypto name, the date and the scale of the ticker wether it be "months" or "years"
